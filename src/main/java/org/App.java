/*
An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program that uses a knowledge base
and a set of rules to perform a task that a human expert might do.
Many websites are available that will help you self-diagnose a medical issue by answering a series of questions.
And many hardware and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools to help people solve simple technical issues
before calling a human.

Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car.
Use the following decision tree to build the system:

Example Output
Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
Are the battery terminals corroded? n
The battery cables may be damaged.
Replace cables and try again.

Constraint
Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the previous answers. Donâ€™t ask for all inputs at once.
